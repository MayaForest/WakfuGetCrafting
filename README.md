This project is a crafting calculator for the game Wakfu.
It works in ranges of 10 levels. Based on data from the Progress.txt file, the program will print out crops and recipes needed to level up all professions from the lowest range to the next one.

This is a first attempt, feel free to share on any errors found.

The Progress.txt file inside the GameInfo folder is meant to be customized with in-game data.
Note that the guild percentage can be negative, to account for penalities I hadn't considered.

Future plans :
- Taking bread recipes into consideration for baker xp and crops.
- Combining doubled crop outputs when two professions need the same ones.
- Lining up the text in the command line output.
- Considering other bonuses/penalties than the guild percentage.
- Options other than leveling up all professions with level below lowest multiple of 10.
- Making this README more professional.
- Getting a pop up with the result when executing instead of having to use the command prompt.

Any feedback or addition is appreciated! (You can reach me on discord @bacon.de.licorne)
